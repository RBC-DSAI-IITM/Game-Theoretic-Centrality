# Game 1: Number of agents at-most 1 hop away

This algorithm computes centrality by considering the fringe as the set of nodes that are reached in at-most one hop. It has a running time of O(V + E), where V = total vertices and E = total edges. For details, please see section `3.2` of the publication.
