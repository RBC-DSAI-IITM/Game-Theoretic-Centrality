# Game 2: Number of agents with at least k neighbors in C (coalition)

This algorithm computes centrality by considering the fringe as the set of nodes that are either in the coalition or that are adjacent to at least k nodes which are already in the coalition. It has a running time of O(V + E), where V = total vetices and E = total edges. For details, please see section `3.3` of the publication.
