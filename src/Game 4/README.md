# Game 4: Number of agents in the network

This algorithm computes centrality by considering the fringe as the set of all nodes in the network. It has a running time of O(V E + V<sup>2</sup> log(v)), where V = total vertices and E = toal edges. For details, please see section `3.5` of the publication.
